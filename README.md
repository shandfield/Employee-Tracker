## Motivation

I wanted to help out a family friend that had a pretty basic website for her business and make more polished and user intuitive one. She is a small buisness owner, and sells products for people and animals to help heal with CBD. She also sells essential oils and other pet products. I really wanted to help her grow her business as well, espcially with COVID 19 happening. 

## Technologies
MySQL, as it was used to set up the schema for the three different data tables. 
HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap for now, more to come as the build continues.

## Instructions
First you will want to clone this repo, and then initiate your termanial. Type in git clone paste the link. Make sure to cd into the new repo, and then you can run npm i to install the necessary packages. Once that has been completed, you will be able to run node server.js, this will prompt the userMenu where it will ask if the user would like to Create, View, Update or Exit. 

## Prompts
When Create is clicked it, another prompt comes up asking the user which area they would like to create: department, role, employee or exit. When the user clicks on department it will ask one question, then move right into the role questions to collect the data and finally the employee section. Once the necessary data is gathered, it is then sent to MySQL and stored there. If the user would like to see any of the data tables, they would just need to select View. This will also prompt the user in which table they would like to view. At this time, the update function only allows the user to update the role_id in the employee table. 

## Future Development 
 I plan to work on the update functions and the ability to delete any entries made. 

## Contributing
At this time, please do not fork or contribute to this project. As this is a personal project for a family friend.
