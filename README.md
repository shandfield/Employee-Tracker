A project created to assist companies in being able to either create, view or update employees. By utilizing three different data tables created in My SQL that holds the data. Users are able to initiate via the termanial, then npm i the necessary packages needed to run this program. Once that has been completed, the user then types out node server.js, this will prompt the userMenu where it will ask if the user wants to Create, View, Update or Exit. When Create is clicked it, then another prompt comes up asking the user which area they would like to create, department, role, employee or exit. When the user clicks on department it will ask one question, then move right into the role questions to collect the data and finally the employee section. Once the necessary data is gathered, it is then sent to MySQL and stored there. If the user would like to see any of the data tables, they would just need to select View. This will also prompt the user in which table they would like to view. At this time, the update function only allows the user to update the role_id in the employee table. 
Udpates after submission, will be to work on the console.tables package, adding in other update functions, and the ability to delete any entries made. As well as more work/development on the README.
